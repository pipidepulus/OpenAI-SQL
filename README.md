# OpenAI-SQL (NLP to SQL)

In this project, we'll develop a start-up that can take a non-technical manager's Natural Language question, such as "What counties had the top sales?" and convert that into a SQL query. We will then use that SQL to query the data (which in this example will come from a .csv file we read in with Pandas and set-up a temporary DB in RAM) and then report back the results!
